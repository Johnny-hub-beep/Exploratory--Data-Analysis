## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Defined analytical questions
- Explored dataset structure and data types
- Performed data quality checks
- Identified trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Tested hypotheses using statistical analysis and visualization

## Conclusion
This EDA provides insights into sales performance and establishes a strong foundation for further analysis or predictive modeling.
